- B2B operations requiring simplified purchasing

**Implementation Approach**: Use PayPal Vault API
```javascript
// Example: PayPal Vault API call needed
// POST /v3/vault/payment-tokens
// Save customer's PayPal account or credit card information
```

### 2. updatePayment ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Feature Description
Update payment amount after creation (e.g., cart amount changes)

#### Impact Analysis

##### üü° Medium Impact
1. **Cart Modification Limitations**
   - Cannot modify order amount after user approves payment on PayPal
   - Must cancel and recreate payment if changes needed

2. **Shipping Calculation**
   - Cannot update if shipping calculated after PayPal approval
   - Must determine final amount before creating PayPal order

##### üü¢ Minimal Actual Impact
- PayPal API design limitation accepted by most merchants
- Similar limitations exist in Stripe and other providers
- Can be mitigated with good UX design

#### Implementation Recommendations
**Priority: Low** - PayPal API doesn't support updating created orders
**Workarounds**:
- Lock order before sending to PayPal
- Provide clear order confirmation steps
- Cancel and recreate if modifications needed

### 3. constructWebhookEvent ‚úÖ (Implemented)

#### Feature Description
Validate webhook request signatures to ensure requests originate from PayPal

#### Impact Analysis

##### üî¥ Security Impact (Resolved)
1. **Security Risks** (Fixed)
   - ~~Cannot verify webhooks are from PayPal~~
   - ~~Vulnerable to forged webhook attacks~~
   - ~~Could lead to false order confirmations~~

2. **Production Risks** (Fixed)
   - ~~Attackers could forge "payment successful" notifications~~
   - ~~Could result in shipping without payment~~

##### üü¢ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Full webhook signature verification implemented
- ‚úÖ Uses PayPal API to verify each webhook
- ‚úÖ Production security standards met

#### Implementation Details (Completed 2025-09-10)
```javascript
// PayPal webhook signature verification implemented
async verifyWebhook({ headers, body }) {
  // Verify signature using PayPal API
  // POST /v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature
  const verification = await paypal.notification.verifyWebhookSignature({
    auth_algo: headers['paypal-auth-algo'],
    cert_url: headers['paypal-cert-url'],
    transmission_id: headers['paypal-transmission-id'],
    transmission_sig: headers['paypal-transmission-sig'],
    transmission_time: headers['paypal-transmission-time'],
    webhook_id: this.webhookId,
    webhook_event: body
  });
  return verification.verification_status === 'SUCCESS';
}
```

## Webhook Verification Implementation (2025-09-10)

### Overview
Successfully implemented PayPal webhook signature verification similar to Stripe's implementation, addressing the critical security gap identified in the feature comparison analysis.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. New Method: `constructWebhookEvent`
Located in `/src/providers/paypal/service.ts`

**Purpose**: Validates and constructs webhook events from PayPal, similar to Stripe's webhook event construction.

**Key Features**:
- Validates all required PayPal webhook headers are present
- Parses and structures the webhook payload
- Returns a formatted event object for further processing

**Required Headers**:
- `paypal-auth-algo`: Signature algorithm used
- `paypal-cert-url`: PayPal's certificate URL
- `paypal-transmission-id`: Unique transmission identifier
- `paypal-transmission-sig`: Webhook signature
- `paypal-transmission-time`: Timestamp of the webhook

#### 2. Enhanced Method: `getWebhookActionAndData`
**Improvements**:
- Added webhook signature verification using PayPal's API
- Expanded event type support from 2 to 8+ event types
- Proper mapping to Medusa's `PaymentActions` enum
- Better error handling and logging

**Supported Event Types**:
| PayPal Event | PaymentActions Mapping |
|-------------|------------------------|
| CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED | AUTHORIZED |
| PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED | SUCCESSFUL |
| PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED | FAILED |
| PAYMENT.CAPTURE.PENDING | PENDING |
| PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED | NOT_SUPPORTED* |
| PAYMENT.AUTHORIZATION.CREATED | AUTHORIZED |
| PAYMENT.AUTHORIZATION.VOIDED | CANCELED |
| CHECKOUT.ORDER.CANCELLED | CANCELED |
| Others | NOT_SUPPORTED |

*Refunds are handled separately through the refund workflow

#### 3. Webhook Verification Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Webhook Received] --> B[constructWebhookEvent]
    B --> C{Headers Valid?}
    C -->|No| D[Throw Error]
    C -->|Yes| E[Parse Payload]
    E --> F[getWebhookActionAndData]
    F --> G[Verify with PayPal API]
    G --> H{Signature Valid?}
    H -->|No| I[Return Error]
    H -->|Yes| J[Map to PaymentAction]
    J --> K[Return Action & Data]
```

### Security Improvements

#### Before Implementation
- ‚ùå No webhook signature verification
- ‚ùå Vulnerable to forged webhook attacks
- ‚ùå Could process fake payment notifications
- ‚ùå Limited event type support

#### After Implementation
- ‚úÖ Full webhook signature verification via PayPal API
- ‚úÖ Protection against forged webhooks
- ‚úÖ Secure payment notification processing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive event type coverage

### Testing

Created test script `test-webhook-verification.js` that validates:
1. Header validation logic
2. Event parsing functionality
3. Event type to PaymentAction mapping

### Configuration Requirements

#### Required Environment Variables
```env
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your_webhook_id_here
```

The webhook ID is essential for signature verification and must be obtained from your PayPal developer dashboard.

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` environment variable
- [ ] Configure webhook URL in PayPal dashboard
- [ ] Enable webhook events for all payment types
- [ ] Test webhook verification in sandbox environment
- [ ] Monitor webhook processing logs

### API Changes

#### PaypalService Class
- Added `verifyWebhook` method in `paypal-core.ts`
- Uses PayPal's `/v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature` endpoint
- Returns verification status and validated payload

#### Error Handling
- Throws `MedusaError` for missing webhook ID
- Proper error messages for invalid signatures
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Comparison with Stripe Implementation
